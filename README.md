# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary
  * In this project, I utilized leaflet to map earthquakes across the world. Multiple layers were used so that the user would have control over what he/she wants to see. The map layers include a standard map layer, a satellite layer, and a dark mode layer. The user can have control over the design of the map. These layers were produced by using an API call to mapbox. Furthermore, 3 earthquake layers were added to the map. The first being all earthquakes happening in the past week. A second layer is all of the major earthquakes (magnitude > 4.5) for the week. This earthquake data was pulled from the US geological services page pertaining to earthquakes. Lastly, an outline of the tectonic plate boundaries was added to show the correlation between earthquakes and these boundaries. These boundary coordinates were pulled from a JSON file from github.
